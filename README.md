# WeatherWidget

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.3.
I built this project based on a youtube video, it served educational purposes. 
It uses openweathermap api to fetch data that is displayed on the screen. Although the pictures are uploaded too, on Github pages they don't get displayed.
